# Purpose

Understand the codebase, project and operate on the sandbox_cli.

## Workflow

- Execute /prime top to bottom
- @apps/sandbox_cli/README.md
- @apps/sandbox_cli/src/main.py
- Run `cd apps/sandbox_cli` 
- Run `uv run sbx --help` to get more details on specific commands
- Then repeat the process for each command in the sandbox_cli `uv run sbx <command> --help`
- IMPORTANT: Don't read the individual command files unless you need to make changes, rely on `uv run sbx <command> --help` to get more details on specific commands

## Report

Report your understandings of the codebase and the project and how each command in the sandbox_cli works.
