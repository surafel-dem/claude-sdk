# Research Plan: Anthropic Agent SDK vs Vercel AI SDK

## Objective
Compare the challenges and trade-offs developers face when building AI agents using Anthropic's Agent SDK versus Vercel AI SDK.

## Key Questions
1. What are the core architectural differences between the two SDKs?
2. What are the main pain points and challenges reported by developers using each SDK?
3. How do they compare in terms of:
   - Agentic capabilities and tool use
   - State management and context handling
   - Error handling and debugging
   - Integration complexity
   - Customization and extensibility
4. What use cases is each SDK better suited for?
5. What are the learning curves and documentation quality like for each?

## Scope
- Focus on current versions of both SDKs (as of 2026)
- Include real-world developer experiences and common pitfalls
- Cover both TypeScript/JavaScript implementations
- Examine documentation, community support, and ecosystem
- Consider production deployment challenges

## Research Approach
1. Search for official documentation and announcements
2. Look for developer blog posts, tutorials, and case studies
3. Find GitHub issues and discussions highlighting challenges
4. Search for comparative analyses and performance benchmarks
5. Review community feedback and Stack Overflow discussions
