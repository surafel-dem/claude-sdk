I want you to analyze all the meeting transcripts in this folder to find patterns in how clients describe their problems, what questions they ask, and what concerns they raise. **If it does not cause frustration, stress, fear, or confusion, it does not count.**

### Before you start

1. **Create a context markdown file** that contains the goal of this analysis: extracting customer pain points in their own words for future content creation
2. **Create a todos markdown file** to track which files you've analyzed and what you've found
3. **Create an insights markdown file** that you iteratively update after processing each transcript

### As you work

* Iteratively update the insights file after processing each transcript
* Check off each transcript in the todos as you complete them and **make sure it's updated before your memory gets compacted**
* After any memory compaction, **read context and todos files before continuing**

### For each transcript, extract

* Exact phrases used to describe problems or pain points
* Questions asked
* Concerns or hesitations mentioned

Work through all the files untill complete.
